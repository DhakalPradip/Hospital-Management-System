A relational database for a hospital management system created by using SQL in SQL Server Management Studio.

The original data is listed in the DHAKAL.xls file. We then created tables for all the data from the excel file, and all the tables are normalized into the Boyce-Codd Normal Form.
See the DHAKAL_NORMALIZATION file for detail.
The ERD and Database Model files display the relationship between each table in the database.
The backup file (DHAKAL.bak) is also attached to this repository.
